<h4>Compositional Operations and their Properties</h4>
<p style="font-size:10px">Many problems induced by compositional data can be aleviated by working with <i><b>log-ratios</b></i> of components. John Aitchison (1985) outlined several operations for working with compositions:</p>
<ul style="font-size:10px">
  <li>Additive Log-Ratio (ALR): \( ALR (x_i) = log (\frac{x_i}{x_D})  \), where \(x_D\) is the \(D^{th}\) component of the vector X.</li>
  <li>Centered Log-Ratio (CLR): \( CLR (x_i) = log( \frac{x_i}{g(X)} \), where \(g(X)\) is the geometric mean of X.</li>
</ul>
