<h4>Properties of Compositional Data</h4>
  
<ul style="font-size:12px">
  <li>Relative abundance data arise from a sum constraint: \(\sum_{i=1}^{D} t_i = \mathbb{T}\)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>\(t_i\) gives the number of reads to sample \(i\) in a sequencing run with \(D\) samples.</li>
    <li>The sum constraint, \(\mathbb{T}\), can change between platforms, sequencing runs, and samples.</li>
    <li>This leads to an arbitrary difference in <i>scale</i> between samples.</li>
  </ul>
  <li style="margin-top:15px">Compositions lie in the \(D-1\) dimensional simplex (\(S^{D-1}\)).  As a result of the constraints on compositional data, the covariance matrix of an un-transformed composition is difficult to interpret.</li>
</ul>
